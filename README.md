- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BhavChan or Bhavana Chandani
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things (Curiosity is a strength).
  In my time away from the computer I enjoy diving, running, hiking, yoga, cubing. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and R to improve my technical skills as a Data analyst.
  I have a backgroud in business operations and have recently made the switch to data analyst.
